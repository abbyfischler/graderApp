# Grade App
## A way to help you calculate your grades!

This is a HW assignment for my CS class. There are 3 versions.

1) In the first version of The Grader our program only gave out letter grades with no modifiers. For example there were no B+’s only B’s. Grader2.java assigns + and - to grades. This grading system is alligned to the one in the syllabus. For this assignment I choose to use nested if statements.

2) The same thing as version 1 but with aion that takes an average and returns the grade modifier if one is needed. This is in file (Grader2 _2)

3) Interactive Grader: prompts the user to enter any number of grades that they want, one at a time, and outputs the students grade - with the modifier - AND their grade fraction when they are done. 999 is to be entered once all the given values are answered.

## To run code

export PATH=$PATH:.  
Type this command in the Console EVERY TIME you start working!!  TYPE IT EXACTLY INCLUDING THE '.' AT THE END. That command will set you up to work.

To run your code type the following in the console (including the '.' and space at the beginning):  

. run NameOfTheApplication ~optional parameters~  

For instance, to run the 3 homework problems you would type the following:

	1) . run Grader2 # # # (where #'s are the test scores)

	2) . run InteractiveGrader

	3) . run Grader3
